## My process

1) Built a simple mockup with borders
2) Tuned the behavior of mobile and desktop versions of cards with flexbox
3) Tuned the colors and styling, added custom font

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project positioning elements was quite a pain in the back, but in the end I had several ideas on what measurement units to use, where to place breakpoint etc. So, a lot of practice on semantic html in one challenge.

### Useful resources

- [CSS box-shadow generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me w/ styling the outer shadow of the card
- [Adobe color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) - A great tool I've used to find complementary colors to make hover effect for the button
- [Flex cheatsheet](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/) - This helped me a lot w/ setting up flexbox
